# Check_Brackets
There is a character string.
The line can be curly, round, square
brackets. The brackets can be open and close.
It is necessary to check the correctness of the brackets placement.
In this case, it is necessary that the following
regulations:
1. Each open parenthesis must have this on the right
the same closing. The converse must also be true.
2. Opening and closing pairs of brackets of different
types must be correctly positioned in relation to each other.
If all the rules are observed, output an informational
message about the correctness of the line, otherwise show the line
to the place where the first error occurred.
